# Dice Simulation Project

## Overview
This Dice Simulation project is designed to demonstrate various functionalities of a dice rolling system using Unity. It includes the ability to roll dice, apply modifiers to rolls, and calculate probabilities of specific roll outcomes. This project is ideal for game developers looking to implement a dice-based mechanic in their games or for educational purposes to understand randomness and probability in programming.

## Features
- **Roll Multiple Dice**: Simulate rolling multiple dice at once.
- **Modifiers on Rolls**: Apply numeric modifiers to the rolls to simulate various game scenarios.
- **Probability Calculations**: Calculate the probability of rolling any specific number on the dice.
- **Result Logging**: Log the results of multiple dice rolls to analyze the distribution and check for randomness.
